- name: Diagnosing Data Analytic Problems in the Classroom
  authors: "Peng, R., **Chen, A.**, Bridgeford, E., Leek, J. T. & Hicks, S. C. "
  timeline: "Aug 2021"
  organization:
    name: Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education

  courseOverview: "Teaching data analysis by providing students with real-world 
  problems and datasets allows students to integrate a variety of skills in a 
  situation that mirrors how data analysis actually works. However, whole data 
  analyses may obscure the individual skills of data analytic practice that are 
  generalizable across data analyses. One such skill is the ability to diagnose 
  the cause of unexpected results in a data analysis. We describe an approach to 
  teaching students skills in diagnosing data analytic problems."

- name: HIV Antibody Profiles in HIV Controllers and Persons With Treatment-Induced Viral Suppression
  authors: "Kammers, K., **Chen, A.**, Monaco, D. R., Hudelson, S. E., Grant-McAuley, W., Moore, R. D., Alter, G., Deeks, S. G., Morrison, C. S., Eller, L. A.,
Blankson, J. N., Laeyendecker, O., Ruczinski, I., Eshleman, S. H. & Larman, H. B."

    url: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.740395/full
  courseOverview: "Low HIV viral load is associated with delayed disease progression and reduced HIV transmission. HIV controllers suppress viral load to low levels in the absence of antiretroviral treatment (ART). We used an antibody profiling system, VirScan, to compare antibody reactivity and specificity in HIV controllers, non-controllers with treatment-induced viral suppression, and viremic non-controllers."

- name: A top scoring pairs classifier for recent HIV infections
  authors: "**Chen, A.**, Laeyendecker, O., Eshleman, S. H., Monaco, D. R., Kammers, K., Larman, H. B. & Ruczinski, I."
  timeline: "Mar 2021"
  organization:
    name: Statistics in Medicine
    url: "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.8920"
  courseOverview: "As availability and use of antiretroviral treatment increase worldwide, algorithms that do not include HIV viral load and are not impacted by viral suppression are needed for cross-sectional HIV incidence estimation. Using a phage display system to quantify antibody binding to over 3300 HIV peptides, we present a classifier based on top scoring peptide pairs that identifies recent infections using HIV antibody responses alone."

  courseOverview: "SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) antibody therapies, including COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP), monoclonal antibodies, and hyperimmune globulin, are among the leading treatments for individuals with early COVID-19 infection. The functionality of convalescent plasma varies greatly, but the association of antibody epitope specificities with plasma functionality remains uncharacterized. We assessed antibody functionality and reactivities to peptides across the CoV2 and the 4 endemic human coronavirus (HCoV) genomes in 126 CCP donations."

  courseOverview: "Most of the fascinating phenomena studied in cell biology emerge from interactions among highly organized multimolecular structures embedded into complex and frequently dynamic cellular morphologies. For the exploration of such systems, computer simulation has proved to be an invaluable tool, and many researchers in this field have developed sophisticated computational models for application to specific cell biological questions. We have defined a series of computational test cases ranging from very simple to moderately complex, varying key features of dimensionality, reaction type, reaction speed, crowding, and cell size. We then quantified how explicit spatial and/or stochastic implementations alter outcomes, even when all methods use the same reaction network, rates, and concentrations."
